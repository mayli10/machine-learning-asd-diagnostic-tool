########## Splitting Data into Testing & Training Sets ##########

#reorders and randomizes the rows so that I take different training and testing data sets
adult.data <- adult.data[sample(nrow(adult.data)),]
adult.data

threeFourths <- round(703*.75)
threeFourths
adult.data.train = adult.data[1:threeFourths, ] # about 75%
adult.data.test  = adult.data[(threeFourths+1):nrow(adult.data), ] # the rest

#typeof(adult.data$a1.score)
#adult.data$a1.score

round(prop.table(table(adult.data.train$has.autism.correct.response))*100)
round(prop.table(table(adult.data.test$has.autism.correct.response))*100) #they are similar


########## Using Bayes theorem ##########

# Storing model in adult.classifier
# train data
adult.classifier = naiveBayes(adult.data.train[, 1:1], adult.data.train$has.autism.correct.response)

#test data
adult.test.predicted = predict(adult.classifier,
                               adult.data.test[, 1:1])
adult.test.predicted

library(caret)

actual.outcome = adult.data.test$has.autism.correct.response
predicted.outcome = predict(adult.classifier, adult.data.test)

predicted.outcome

confusionMatrix(actual.outcome,predicted.outcome)
#initial kappa value = 1
# accuracy rate: 1
# error rate: 0

########## Analyzing Results ##########

#CrossTable() is from gmodels
CrossTable(adult.test.predicted,

           prop.chisq = FALSE, # as before
           prop.t     = FALSE, # eliminate cell proprtions
